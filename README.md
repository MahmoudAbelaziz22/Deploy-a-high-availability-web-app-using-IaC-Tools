# Deploy-a-high-availability-web-app-using-IaC-Tools

In this project, I deploy a web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation and Terraform. I write the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Instagram-like app from the ground up. I begin with deploying the networking components, followed by servers, security roles and software.
